# Challenge Session 02 - Aug. 3rd, 2016


For this session we will be using the specdata files used to answer the programming assignment of week two, and the iris dataset used to answer some quiz questions for week 3. The specguide data can be downloaded from the data source folder in this repository.
This week consists of 15 questions. You will notice that the initial questions are basic exploratory questions, and the following ones are expected to be completed with the knoweledge gained in weeks 2 and 3 of the R programming course.

As in the previous session:
  These questions are to be submitted with a push to GitHub with the code used, and if applicable, the answer (output). The time of the push will be considered as the submit time, hence the winner will be whoever submitted the correct code/answer faster.


Using the 331 files from specdata
1) Create a single function to load the dataset of complete cases given the folder location:
  eg. load_complete('specdata')
2) What are the dimensions (number of rows and columns) of the dataset.
3) Specify the column name and the data type for each column of the dataset.
4) What is the minimum and maximum of all the numeric columns of the dataset.
5) What is the date range of the data included. (earliest and latest day that can be found) in the dataset
6) Get the daily mean for the sulfate polutant levels in the dataset.
7) Get the mean nitrate levels for each monitor in the dataset.

Using iris dataset 
8) Load the iris dataset
9) What are the dimensions of the iris dataset?
10) What are the column name and the data type for each column in the iris dataset?
11) What is the minimum and maximum of all the numeric columns in the iris dataset?
12) What are the different categories of species that exist in the iris dataset? 
13) What is the mean sepal length for the species versicolor in the iris dataset?
14) Obtain a vector with the means of the sepal lenght, sepal width, petal length and petal width across all species from the iris dataset.
15) Obtain the mean petal length for each of the species.
