# Challenge Session 01 - July 20th, 2016

For this session we will be using the weather dataset used to answer the quiz from week 1. It can be downloaded from the data source folder in this repository

This week consists of 14 questions. These questions are to be submitted with a push to GitHub with the code used, and if applicable, the answer (output). The time of the push will be considered as the submit time, hence the winner will be whoever submitted the correct code/answer faster.

Next are the questions:

1) What are the dimensions (number of rows and number of columns) of the data set?

2) What is the name of the last column of the data set?

3) For the same column, what is the datatype?

4) List all values for the 50th item (values in line 50) in the data set?

5) Remove from the data all records with NA in the first column in the data set.

6) List all values for the new 50th item (values in line 50) in the data set?

7) Remove all incomplete cases from the dataset (row with an NA in any column).

8) What are the dimensions of the data set for all complete cases? 

9) Get the date (day and month) with the highest Ozone value for all complete cases in the dataset.

10) Create a subset with only the 7th and 9th months.

11) What is the average temperature in the subset created in question 10?

12) What is Fridays??? average temperature of the subset created in question 10?

13) Create a table containing the Wind's average, minimum value, 25th percentile (2nd quartile), median value, 75th percentile (3rd quartile) and maximum value for May and August (month 5 and 8) complete cases for all days in the dataset. (Consider the data is for the year 2016)

14) Create a table containing the Wind's average, minimum value, 25th percentile (2nd quartile), median value, 75th percentile (3rd quartile) and maximum value for May and August (month 5 and 8) complete cases for all days except Mondays in the dataset. (Consider the data is for the year 2016)
