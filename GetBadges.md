# GetBadges

Starting Session 4, we'll use the `GetBadges` portal to have a more interactive way to acknowledge your participation through `GitHub`.

To participate in GetBadges you have to go to https://relizalde-dsjhu01.getbadges.io/
and follow the instructions after clicking `Sign up to join this game`. It's important that you use your `GitHub` credentials so the game can follow your activity there.

The game is pointing to [this](https://github.com/relizalde/DSJHU01) repository which is a forked version of the course repository. Please push your results the _challengers_ folder on the corresponding session directory.

The general steps are as follow:
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the forked version on your computer
3. Work in your local repository
4. Pushed the changes to remote
5. Create a Pull Request from your repository to the one for the game.

GetBadges will detect the changes on the original repository and will assigned different badges depending on your work.

Please consider that it could take up to one day to see the updated information on GetBadges.

## How to update your fork repository?
Took from [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7244321/how-do-i-update-a-github-forked-repository)

1. Open your fork repository on GitHub.
2. Click on `Pull Requests`.
3. Click on `New Pull Request`. By default, GitHub will compare the original with your fork, and there shouldn't be nothing to compare if you didn't make any changes.
4. Click on __switching the base__ (if no changes were made in the fork) or click Edit and __switch the base manually__. Now GitHub will compare your fork with the original, and you should see all the latest changes.
5. Click on `Create` to create a pull request for this comparison and assign a predictable name to your pull request (e.g., Update from original).
6. Click on `Send pull request`.
7. Scroll down and click `Merge pull request` and finally `Confirm merge` (If your fork didn't have any changes, you will be able to merge it automatically).

## How to create a `Pull Request` to the original repository?
After pushing your changes to your remote fork repository, you can continue with the following steps:

1. Open your fork repository on GitHub.
2. Click on `Pull Requests`.
3. Click on `New Pull Request`.
4. Make sure that the base fork is the destination repository and the head fork is pointing to your repository.
5. Click on `Create` to create a pull request for this comparison and assign a name to your pull request.
6. Click on `Send pull request`.
7. Please don't merge the pull request.
