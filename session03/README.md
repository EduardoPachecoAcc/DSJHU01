# Challenge Session 03 - August 17th, 2016

For this session we will mainly be downloading infromation from the web. For those without internet access don't worry as we'll use the files from the week1 quizz for getting and cleaning data.

This week consists of 10 questions +2 optionals. Please note that for getting into the leaderboard, you only have to answer the first 11 questions.

As in the previous session:
  These questions are to be submitted with a push to GitHub with the code used, and if applicable, the answer (output). The time of the push will be considered as the submit time, hence the winner will be whoever submitted the correct code/answer faster.


Next are the questions:

1) create a vector with 10000 random normal values with a mean of 15 and a standard deviation of 35 (seed at 1439).

2) create a vector with 10000 random normal values with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.

3) Get the density of the probability distribution function for each vector.

4) Plot the result from question 3, with it's corresponding vector.

5) Download the the gas excel file used for quizz 1 of Getting and Cleaning Data (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FDATA.gov_NGAP.xlsx) and load the contractor table.

6) Give the dimmensions and column names for each column.

7) How many contractors are in Tulsa?

8) Download the last csv file used in the quizz 1 of getting and cleaning data ( URL 'https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2Fss06pid.csv') and load it into a data table. 

9) What is the average age in the data?.

10) What is the average age by gender.

11) Load the xml file from the getting and cleaning data quizz 1 (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2Frestaurants.xml), and get the number of restaurants by police district (policedistrict). (3 extra point)

12) The programming assignment for week 3, in the R programming course, uses functions to obtain the best hospital by state, to rank all hospital by best or worst, and to rank hospital by state and outcome. Alter this functions to filter by a minimal number of cases (given as a new input for the formulas) for their analysis, and set the default to be 25. (5 extra points for each formula correctly modified)
